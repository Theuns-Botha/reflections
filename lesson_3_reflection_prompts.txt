When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use the repository for  -storing my files and their version control history online
                                            -Accessing the files from a different computer
                                            -Collaborating with other people on the same files/projects

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic tracking would clutter my repository with "works-in-progress" rather than just the changes that I was happy with to store/share
